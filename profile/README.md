## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [AI Email Categorization](https://github.com/whowillguardtheguardians/ai-email-categorization)
Multi-agent AI system for intelligent email classification using AWS Bedrock and RAG. Features self-learning capabilities and privacy-first design. 
This project showcases that the performance of a multi agent architecture yields better accuracy results than using a single agent. We propose a three aget system with a
primary classifying agent, a quality assurance agent that evaluates the work of the classification agent and then a judge agent to make the final decision when there is a disagreement between the 
classifying and QA Agent. As a data source we use email. 

**Tech Stack:** Python, AWS Bedrock, Machine Learning, Multi-Agent Systems
